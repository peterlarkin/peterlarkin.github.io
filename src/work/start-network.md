Around the world, crises are lasting longer and affecting more people. 
The existing aid system is slow, inefficient and no longer fit for purpose.

**How do you establish a brand amongst incumbents like the UN and the British Red Cross?**

#### The insight 

The Start Network is made up of 42 aid agencies working together to create a more efficient way to deliver aid. While its members recognise the need for change, they felt increasingly uninspired by the slow decision-making process and bureaucracy that plagues the charity sector. They needed the Start Network to motivate and guide them in the right direction.

#### The strategy 

We positioned Start Network as a challenger, one that brought new thinking to the table and constantly challenged the status quo. Think Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a room full of middle-aged politicians. The identity avoided the usual charity tropes, instead opting for vibrant colours and a bold strikethrough treatment that signalled a new era of humanitarian aid.
